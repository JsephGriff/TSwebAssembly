# Introduction

This project provides a compiler that translates Metsu code into WebAssembly. WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine, designed to be a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.
Features

    Efficient Compilation: Converts Metsu code to WebAssembly for high-performance execution.
    Cross-Platform: Supports multiple operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    Easy Integration: Seamlessly integrates with existing web projects.
    Open Source: Licensed under the MIT License.

Installation
Prerequisites

    Node.js (version 14 or higher)
    npm (version 6 or higher)

Steps

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/metsu-wasm-compiler.git
    cd metsu-wasm-compiler

    Install dependencies:

    npm install

    Build the compiler:

    npm run build

Usage
Compiling Metsu Code

To compile a Metsu file to WebAssembly, use the following command:

npm run compile -- input.metsu -o output.wasm

Running the WebAssembly Module

You can run the generated WebAssembly module in a web environment. Hereâ€™s a basic example using JavaScript:

fetch('output.wasm').then(response =>
  response.arrayBuffer()
).then(bytes =>
  WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes)
).then(results => {
  results.instance.exports.main();
});

Examples
Hello World

Create a file named hello.metsu with the following content:

print("Hello, WebAssembly!")

Compile and run it:

npm run compile -- hello.metsu -o hello.wasm

Then, use the JavaScript example above to run hello.wasm in your browser.
