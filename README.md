# Introduction

This project provides a compiler that translates Metsu code into WebAssembly. WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine, designed to be a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

# Features

* Efficient Compilation: Converts Metsu code to WebAssembly for high-performance execution.
* Cross-Platform: Supports multiple operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* Easy Integration: Seamlessly integrates with existing web projects.
* Open Source: Licensed under the MIT License.

# Installation
### Prerequisites

* Node.js (version 14 or higher)
* npm (version 6 or higher)
* wasm (version 1.0 or higher)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/metsu-wasm-compiler.git
cd metsu-wasm-compiler
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
    npm install
```
3. Build the compiler:
```
    npm run build
```
# Usage
### Compiling Metsu Code

To compile a Metsu file to WebAssembly, use the following command:

npm run compile -- input.metsu -o output.wasm

Running the WebAssembly Module

You can run the generated WebAssembly module in a web environment. Hereâ€™s a basic example using JavaScript:

```
fetch('output.wasm').then(response =>
  response.arrayBuffer()
).then(bytes =>
  WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes)
).then(results => {
  results.instance.exports.main();
});
```

# Examples
Please refer to the examples provided within the [Metsu](https://github.com/JoshnaksPNG/Metsu) Project.
Note that return values implementation is still a work in progress.
